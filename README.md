just wanted to use my drawing books cover pages for a
better cause,
in movies n anime ive seen many instances of
using banana leaves as umbrellas so i 
wanted to test its water proof nature,
besides in my country at many places ive
seen people use this as "plates" while eating
so i tried to incorporate that tradition into
a tiffin, its kinda healthy as well smh i read
abt it somewhere
anyway, model artwork in repository
